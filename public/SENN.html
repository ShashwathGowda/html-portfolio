        <h3>About</h3>
            <p> As the development of AI increases day by day,
            we find the need to adapt to ever changing dynamics of the
            digital world. As data becomes more abundant in few cases and
            redundant in other, we need a method that can efficiently and
            effectively analysing and build machine learning models that can
            adapt through this ever-changing environment. At the forefront
            of AI development is neural networks, which have become an
            integral part of every aspect of AI & ML. In this computer heavy
            world, we chose to analyse the root idea of neural networks, i.e.
            natural principles that govern the development of brains and
            neurons in the ever-evolving natural world. We implemented
            nature’s laws and Darwin’s principle, to understand how it can
            affect the development of these neural networks. Using various
            types of neural networks such as ANN, CNN and RNN, in
            multiple tasks such as disease detection, disease classification and
            sentiment analysis, we have identified that our models outperform
            their traditional counterparts, in both accuracy and efficiency.

            A skin disease classifier developed using the neural network
        algorithm in machine learning, adhering to the conventional
        learning approach. The modified version incorporates both
        the genetic principle and the principle of natural selection,
        involving processes such as crossover and mutation.

            Results loss and accuracy graph of models trained using starved data
            and traditional ANN traditional
            The classifier is designed to undergo training with a specified
            generation value, and an additional feature allows the
            training to halt if five consecutive epochs exhibit the same
            accuracy or negligible changes. The accuracy versus epoch
            graphs for the GA and traditional models trained using starved
            data are given in Fig 04,05,06,07. We have observed enhanced
            results in the entire neural network algorithm, when they are
            faced against starved data.
            The ANN GA model shows similar results compared to the
            traditional mode, showing around 82% accuracy using starved
            data, compared to its traditional counterpart showing around
            80%, but at reduced training time, taking 40% less time in
            reaching the same level of accuracy. The CNN GA classifier
            model shows higher results compared to its traditional counterpart,
            getting 20% higher accuracy compared to the traditional
            model.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Our project aimed to explore the advantages of usage of
            genetically modified algorithm, in situation where data is
            sparse or not very well documented or collected. We have
            achieved superior results compared to the traditional models of
            CNN and ANN. While this project was just a scratch, we hope
            to inspire more people to explore the domain of integrating
            biology into artificial intelligence and machine learning, and
            help develop more adaptive AI algorithms for the future.
            We have observed a few drawbacks such as high demand
            on the processing capability requirements for the devices to
            train the algorithms, and as such hope further researchers to
            aid in optimizing this demand of GA algorithms.</p>
